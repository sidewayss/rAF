      <p>These apps were initially conceived for testing the library; then as a way to demonstrate the library; then as a way to generate JavaScript animation code to help fill in for the lack of formal documentation. They all contain Copy Data buttons that copy tabular animation data to the clipboard for validation and analysis. To the immediate right is the Copy Code button, which generates JavaScript code for the currently configured animation and copies it.</p>
      <p><span class="rAF">rAF</span> offers a wide variety of interdependent features. Some properties are arrays of user-defined length. Fitting all that into a suite of apps, much less a single app, is not necessarily desirable. It's certainly a monster to code and probably a monster to use. The apps, Easings in particular, limit the available values for some properties in order to make the interface simpler while still meeting testing requirements. The auto-generated JavaScript code is meant as a starting point, not a finished animation. You have to supply your own HTMLElement, SVGElement, or CSSStyleRule regardless. It's simple enough to alter the property values generated by the app and adapt the code to your web page.</p>
      <p>Note: <span class="rAF">rAF</span> uses milliseconds as the time units. The apps use seconds.</p>
      <p>Note: <span class="rAF">rAF</span> uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_properties">private properties</a>, which are not supported by some older versions of browsers. If your browser is not up to date, or if you're using an older device/OS, go to <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=private%20class">caniuse.com</a> for details on which browser versions offer support (currently 93.07% global support). If the app page doesn't display, this might be the issue. Check the Developer Tools console for more information.</p>

      <h2 id="easings">Easings</h2>
      <img src="../img/easings.jpg" class="scale"/>
      <p><i>The Easings app is not designed for mobile phones. At or below 675px wide by 749px tall it reduces its size to 75% and bottoms out there.</i></p>
      <p>Easings allows you to design one or two-legged timing patterns in a CSS-like model, with flexible ease-in and ease-out settings. <span class="rAF">rAF</span> allows for unlimited legs, but fitting that in an app is awkward. For user convenience, <span class="rAF">rAF</span> also has settings that mimic this same CSS-like model, and this tests most of those features.</p>
      <p>Timing functions include standard CSS and JQuery functions, with several enhancements. Steps functions are significantly enhanced, with the ability to apply a non-steps easing function to the steps values, timing, or both.  Instead of the JQuery model of separate functions for exponents 2-5, <span class="rAF">rAF</span> lets you specify any number that the <span>Math.pow()</span> function accepts. And more...</p>
      <p>The chart is a 1000 x 1000 SVG canvas, with extra vertical headroom for out of range values &lt;0 and &gt;1000. Yes, with zero it's 1001 x 1001, but as with animation frames in this app, there is a zero value that is outside the animation range: the element's current value, pre-animation. Generally these zero and 1 have identical values, but not with <span>{type:E.steps, jump:E.start}</span>, where the <span>initZero</span> property becomes relevant.</p>
      <p>The chart Y axis is the animation value, which is why there is a second visual indicator of its value to the right of the chart.  The X axis is time, with numbers displayed in seconds, not chart units, and the time navigation slider as well.</p>
      <p style="font-style:italic">What follows is in the terminology of <span class="rAF">rAF</span>, which is not the same as the labels in the app, but they are similar enough and it's organized around the app's layout.</p>
      <p>There are 4 Round Trip properties:
        <br>&emsp;3 booleans: <span>roundTrip flipTrip autoTrip</span>
        <br>&emsp;1 number: <span>tripWait</span>
      </p>
      <p><span>roundTrip</span> turns the feature on or off and enables or disables the other 3 properties.</p>
      <p><span>flipTrip</span> defaults to <span>true</span>: the return aka inbound trip follows the same line as the outbound trip. Setting flipTrip to <span>false</span> causes the inbound trip's line to mirror the outbound trip. Give it a try with any <span>type</span> other than <span>linear</span>, and the chart will illustrate it clearly. It makes no difference for linear.</p>
      <p><span>autoTrip</span> also defaults to <span>true</span>: the animation automatically executes the inbound trip after the outbound trip ends.  The more unusual setting is <span>false</span>, where the animation stops at the end of the outbound trip, but stays in that state so the user can initiate the return trip. You cannot combine <span>autoTrip</span> = <span>false</span> with <span>plays</span> = greater than 1.</p>
      <p><span>tripWait</span> is the number of milliseconds to wait between the end of the outbound trip and the start of the inbound trip.  It affects <span>autoTrip</span> = <span>false</span> too, acting the same as the <span>Easy.prototype.wait</span> property does for the outbound trip. (The <span>wait</span> property is not included in this app as there are already too many inputs and it's easily tested.)</p>
      <p>NOTE: with <span>tripWait</span> set to zero, the animation will rarely get all the way to the end value. The clock keeps running, and unless the frame time stamp is exactly the end time, the two frames around that end time will be close, but not quite the end value. The same applies to <span>loopWait</span>.</p>
      <p><span>plays</span> is the number of times the animation plays. It is an integer, minimum of 1. The app limits it to a max of 3.</p>
      <p><span>plays</span> and <span>loopByElm</span> share a drop-down and a property: <span>loopWait</span> is the number milliseconds between plays or loops by element. The app limits it via the drop-down options.</p>
      <p><span>loopByElm</span> is a boolean that causes the animation to loop one element at a time.</p>
      <p><span>frameZero</span> is in the app for testing only. It's a fine detail of a setting that I'm not going to explain here now. If you're really curious look at the code in <span>aframe.js</span>, which has some explanatory comments. Be careful turning it off for Firefox, as you will reproduce <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1864047">issue 1864047</a>.</p>
      <p><span>useNow</span> uses <span>performance.now()</span> instead of the <span>requestAnimationFrame()</span> timestamps and <span>document.timeline.currentTime</span>.</p>
      <p><span>mid</span>, <span>split</span>, <span>gap</span> are for two-legged easings only. They are shorthands for individual leg properties. Each has a Reset button, and <span>split</span>, <span>gap</span> have Lock buttons. By default Lock is off and <span>split</span>, <span>gap</span> scale relative to duration. You can see them adjust as you move the duration slider. Setting Lock to on keeps the value constant.</p>
      <p><span>mid</span> is the animation value at which the legs change. Defaults to 50% of the distance, in this case 500.</p>
      <p><span>split</span> is the animation time at which the legs change. Defaults to 50%.</p>
      <p><span>gap</span> is the number of milliseconds to wait between the end of the first leg and the start of the second. Defaults to zero.</p>
      <p><span class="bullet" style="font-size:calc(1rem + 1px); font-weight:500;">Draw line as steps</span> is not an <span class="rAF">rAF</span> feature. It is an app feature that draws the chart's line as one step per frame. It's especially useful for viewing contiguous frames with a static value; with <span>gap</span> set greater than zero, for example. It is the more accurate representation of the animation. When it's off, the line is smoothed out to appear continuously changing.</p>

      <h2 id="multi">Multi-Ease</h2>
      <img src="../img/multi-486.jpg"/>
      <p><i>The Multi-Ease app is designed to be used on recent mobile devices in the landscape aka horizontal position, as well as on tablets, laptops, desktops. Baseline size is 484px wide by 356px tall. It's minimum size is somewhere around 405x298. It does not scale, but reduces margins and changes to a smaller font-size and line-height.</i></p>
      <p>Multi-Ease aka Multi allows you to configure animations where you choose a separate timing pattern for each argument in a property, attribute or function, or for masked numbers in an "unstructured" attribute like SVG <span>points</span> or function like CSS <span>linear-gradient()</span>. The app is fixed at 3 timing patterns, which is enough to test, demonstrate, and create starting point code. It animates the CSS <span>clip-path</span> property using the <span>polygon()</span> function.</p>
      <p>The baseline start and end values are 18 and 458. Those are x-coordinates in the polygon. The shape has a min of 0 and a max of 475. The numbers will display fully out-of-range values, but the shape will clip at its min/max.</p>
      <p>The <span>clip-path</span> is filled with a diagonal gradient to clearly illustrate that it's one contiguous shape. There are two HTML color inputs to the right of the time navigation slider. They are for the top-left and bottom-right colors of the gradient, initially set to blue and yellow.</p>
      <p>There are 3 identical blocks of controls, one for each easing. Each block contains:</p>
      <p>An Easy drop-down containing all the easings (aka class Easy) from the Name drop-down in the Easings app, presets and user-defined.</p>
      <p>A Plays drop-down that overrides the plays property set in the Easy, which is to the left of the drop-down. Setting the drop-down to "<span style="font-weight:bold;">&ndash;</span>" defaults to the Easy value.</p>
      <p>A Key drop-down to choose between <span>unit</span> and <span>comp</span>, effectively flipping the animation start and end values.</p>
      <p>An Auto Trip three-state checkbox that only displays if the Easy has <span>roundTrip</span> set to <span>true</span>. As with Plays, the "<span style="font-weight:bold;">&ndash;</span>" indicates defaulting to the Easy's value. The app does not do <span>{roundTrip:true, autoTrip:false}</span>, so this is a toggle of <span>roundTrip</span> too.</p>
      <p>The generated code is slightly simplified from the app's own animation. Animating this particular shape requires 6 masked values, 3 pairs of 2 per Easy. Each pair shares the same value generated by the Easy during animation. The generated code is simplified to one masked value per Easy, removing duplication that muddies the readability.</p>

      <h2 id="color">Color</h2>
      <img src="../img/color-486.jpg"/>
      <p><i>The Color app is designed to be used on recent mobile devices as well as tablets, laptops, desktops. With smaller phone screens you might do best in landscape/horizontal. Baseline control panel size is 395px wide by 286px tall. Collapsed it's only 77px tall. The canvases fill the remaining screen space.</i></p>
      <p>Color allows you to configure and view color animations using CSS and <a href="https://colorjs.io">Color.js</a> color spaces. You can assign any preset or user easing/multi to the animation. It offers a side-by-side comparison mode where you can compare the same animation across two color spaces. You must turn Compare off to access the Copy buttons, which are for a single color. With Compare off you can also highlight out-of-gamut values.</p>
      <img src="../img/color1-486.jpg" style="margin-top:0.75rem"/>
      <p>What looks like a label in the upper left corner is a drop-down with the down arrow on the left side, to appear more label-like. The two options are Easy (easings) and Multi (multi-eases). Changing it swaps the list to the immediate right between named easings and named multis.</p>
      <p>The Time slider overrides the duration of the selected easing or multi, allowing you to control the duration of this color animation.</p>
      <p>Start and End are inputs for the start and end colors in the animation. You can enter CSS-readable text or its cousin, serialized Color.js, in the textboxes. To the right, there are native HTML color inputs embedded in the mini-canvases that display the color itself. Click/touch to open the dialog.  Those native inputs populate the textboxes with RGB colors in hexadecimal notation. Some provide HSL and HWB color pickers in addition to RGB.</p>
      <p>Below that are one or two drop-downs for selecting color space, and text/numeric displays for each selected space:</p>
      <p><span class="symbol" style="font-size:1.75rem; margin-left:-1px;">switch_right</span>&#x2004;is the Compare toggle.</p>
      <p><span class="symbol">monitor</span>&#x2004;is the color space used to display the color on this device, if it differs from the selected space. Derived from <span>Color.prototype.display()</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="symbol">line_start_circle</span>&#x2004;is the row containing the animation start coordinates.</p>
      <p><span class="symbol">horizontal_rule</span>&#x2004;is the row containing the coordinates at the current point in time.</p>
      <p><span class="symbol">line_end_circle</span>&#x2004;is the row containing the animation end coordinates.</p>
      <p><span class="bullet" style="font-size:calc(1rem + 1px); font-weight:500;">gamut</span> lets you select RGB or P3 gamut. With Compare off, the symbol/label for each row that's out of gamut is highlighted in red. I am part way into coding it so that only the individual out-of-gamut coordinates are highlighted, but for now each group of three coords is a single <span>&lt;span&gt;</span>, and I don't want to light up the whole row in red. If you want to add gamuts to the drop-down, submit an issue or a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/sidewayss/rAF">GitHub</a>. AFAIK these two are the basis for the vast majority of display hardware at this time, but it's easy enough to add more.</p>
      <p><span class="symbol">repeat</span>&#x2004;toggles <span>roundTrip</span>, overriding the easing or multi settings. Uses the defaults for related properties: <span>{autoTrip:true, flipTrip:true, tripWait:0}</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="symbol">expand_less</span>&#x2004;collapses the top of the page in order to view more color, less text.</p>
      <p><span class="symbol">expand_more</span>&#x2004;expands it.</p>
      <img src="../img/color2-486.jpg" style="margin-top:0.75rem"/>

      <h2 id="common-features">Common Features</h2>
      <p>All the apps have tooltips for most of the controls. They are enabled by hovering the mouse pointer over the control. If you only have a touch interface then you'd be out of luck were it not for these instructions. The tooltips are implemented in the standard way, as <span>title</span> attribute values.</p>
      <img src="../img/playback.jpg" class="sub"/>
      <p>The playback and time navigation controls are quite standard. Two playback buttons that default to Play and Stop. They change icons during playback to Pause/Resume and Reset. The slider aka range control navigates time when playback is idle. During playback it animates, but is disabled for user control. The slider is rendered differently by each browser and I have not gone the extra mile to style it with the browser-specific CSS tags/properties. The images above are all from Chrome.</p>
      <img src="../img/named+copy.jpg" class="sub"/>
      <p>All the apps have one or more drop-down lists for selecting a named easing or multi. In the Easings and Multi apps the primary one is labeled Name. For steps, Easings has two more such drop-downs, one for Timing, the other for Values. Multi has three of them labeled Easy.  In the Color app they are labeled Easy and Multi.</p>
      <p>These drop-downs contain presets supplied by the app. In Easings and Multi you can add user-defined configurations as well. Those are saved to <span>localStorage</span>. They are all available for selection in Color, but Color does not have a Save button.</p>
      <p>In Easings and Multi, there are 4 buttons that accompany the primary dropdown: Save, Revert to last saved, Revert to preset value, Delete user configuration (can't delete presets).</p>
      <p>There are two Copy buttons: Data and Code. Copy Data copies the currently displayed animation or pseudo-animation's data, by frame, to the clipboard. The clipboard data includes one row of text headers. The first column is always time. After that it varies by app. I use this feature to validate timing functions in a spreadsheet. I paste the data in and spread forumulas around to validate the numbers.</p>
      <p>Copy Code generates starting point code for implementing the current animation, and copies it to the clipboard. I hope this helps users get started using and learning <span class="rAF">rAF</span>. Custom examples is a nice way to get started, at least that's my hope.</p>

      <p>If you're curious as to how <span class="rAF">rAF</span> estimates the device/browser frame rate, open the Developer Tools console.  The apps log the frame timing data and summaries that  <span>AFrame.prototype.fpsBaseline()</span> uses to calculate it. The JavaScript code that runs the baseline calculation is in <span>/apps/load.js/loadFinally()</span>. I say "device/browser" frame rate because some devices don't make all their frame rates available to the browser.  My current Android phone does that.</p>
